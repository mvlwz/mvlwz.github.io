<p>1.Ferragosto</p> 
Part holy-day, part full-blown fiest, Ferragosto takes place every year in Italy on 15th August. It’s a one-day national bank holiday but it trickles into the weeks preceding it. Entire cities empty and everyone flocks to the beach. Depending on where you are in the country, there might be religious processions, ancient palios, parties and food festivals too.<p>It derives from the Latin Feriae Augusti, which Emporer August introduced to celebrate the end of the agricultural working year and give thanks to the God of Earth and Fertility. Workers were invited to celerbate with a day off, performances, horse races and entertainment. In the 1920s, Mussolini made it a national holiday. He introduced the ‘People’s Trains of Ferragosto’ that gave travel discounts to workers to leave the city and head off to the seaside or lakes.</p>
<p>2.Carnevale</p>
Carneavle takes place in the weeks leading up to Easter. It’s a final big bash before lent begins, which usually involves masquerade balls, music, parties and entertainments. Pranks and mischief are a central theme, hence the phrase “a Carnevale ogni scherzo vale,” which means “anything goes at Carnevale.” The tradition dates back to pagan festivals that were adapted with the introduction of Catholicism.<p>While celebrations take place across the country, Venice hosts the best-known celebrations. It starts two weeks before the traditional date, with events and entertainment held nightly. Hotels throw masked balls and offer rented costumes for tourists, events take place in ever sestiere and there are huge gondola and boat parades along the Grand Canal. It all culminates in the fireworks show at Piazza San Marco.</p>
<p>3.Friday weddings are bad luck</p>
When it comes to weddings, Italians are a superstitious bunch. Italians don’t tend to get married on Friday as it’s thought that evil sprits created this day of the week. Tuesdays are also bad luck as couple who marry on this day are more likely to fight in the guture. For maximum guarantees of fertility and prosperity, most Italians opt to say ‘I do’ on a Sunday. Brides should alsoavoid looking in the mirror on your wedding day and guests should never-ever wear white.<p>Another popular tradition sees the groom carry a tiny piece of iron in his jacket pocket to ward away evil spirits. The bride should also make a small tear in her veil to bring the good luck. In Southern Italy, the length of veil should reflect the length of engagement; one metre for every year.</p>
    <p>4.Easter is a bid deal</p>
    With almost 75% of the country identifying as catholic, it comes as no surprise that Easter is a big deal in Italy – but some of the quirky traditions that come with it might do. Celebrations differ across the country too. For instance, in Florence they practice the unique tradition of ‘scoppio de carro’, which means ‘exploding of a cart’. Essentially, this involves decorating a wagon, filling it with fireworks, leading it through the city and then handing it over the Archbishop to shoot a dove-shaped rocket into it for an earth-shuddering explosion.<p>On Palm Sunday, it’s customary to place palm leaves and olive branches outside your home. And while the Easter Bunny is unlikely to make an appearance (it’s not an Italian tradition), fear not, there will be plenty of chocolate eggs to go around. The culinary piece de resistance is the Easter Cake, known as ‘Colomba’. It’s usually made with candied orange peels, almonds and lots of sugar. In the South, thy also eat ‘Pastiera’, a ricotta pie. The day after Easter is a national holiday too.</p>  <p>5.Christmas lasts a really long</p>
    In Italy, Christmas kicks off on 8th December, the Day of the Immaculate Conception. People tend to start putting decorations up around this time, and Romans launch a canon from the Castel Sant’Angelo to officially mark the start of the season. The festivities continue right up until 6th January, the Day of the Epiphany. Between the two dates, there are multiple holidays and celebrations such as St. Ambrose’s Day (Milan) St. Lucia’s Day, Santo Stefano… That’s why Italians say buone feste (happy holidays) rather than buon natale (merry Christmas).

Children typically dress as shepherds and sing Christmas carols in return for sweets or money.</p>
